        <div class="im textHeadings">What is the need of it?</div>
        <div class="im text">The blog succinctly illustrates the crucial role of discrete mathematics in computer science and information technology. It emphasizes how concepts like graph theory and Boolean algebra are essential for algorithm design and network modeling. By showcasing practical applications, the blog underscores the importance of understanding discrete mathematics for those in tech fields.</div>

        <div class="im textHeadings"> Is Discrete Maths algorithm used any where in this website</div>
        <div class="im text">Yes <br> <br> The webpage has the page, designed to find cutsets by inputting vertices and edges, directly applies discrete mathematics algorithms to practical graph theory problems. This illustrates the immediate relevance and utility of discrete mathematics concepts in computer science and information technology.</div>
